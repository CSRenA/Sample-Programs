HOW TO RUN:
First, download Android Studio.
Then, download all files (main GMUQuoteGenerator folder).
After downloading, you can open the project within Android Studio and run it on an emulator.

If there are further questions on how to run the program, I can be reached at lander16@masonlive.gmu.edu
